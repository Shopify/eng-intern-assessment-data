1. Understanding the Task: I begin by examining the instructions provided by Shopify. 

2. Analyzing the Database Schema: After gaining a clear understanding of the instructions, I proceed to analyze the schema.sql file. 
This file provide structure, including the tables it comprises and the relationships between them.

3. Creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): To further understanding of the database, I create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using drawio. 
Please refer to this link for ERD visualization: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zAeur1WeK1nVRAJhzttAcsaWbQTU8DQD/view?usp=sharing
This visual representation helps identify the relationships between different tables, whether they are one-to-many or one-to-one. 

4. Solving Tasks: Armed with a thorough understanding of the database and its structure, I then tackle the tasks at hand. 
I use the data provided, the database schema, and the ERD as my primary tools.

5.Testing Queries: Finally, I test the accuracy of all the queries using Pythonâ€™s pandasql package on test_sql.ipynb and test_sql_queries.py notebooks
This step ensures the integrity of my work and to confirm that the queries return the expected results
