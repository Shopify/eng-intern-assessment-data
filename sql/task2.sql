-- Problem 5: Retrieve the products with the highest average rating
-- Write an SQL query to retrieve the products with the highest average rating.
-- The result should include the product ID, product name, and the average rating.
-- Hint: You may need to use subqueries or common table expressions (CTEs) to solve this problem.
SELECT Products.product_id, product_name, AVG(rating)
FROM Products LEFT JOIN Reviews ON Products.product_id = Reviews.product_id
GROUP BY Products.product_id
ORDER BY AVG(rating) DESC, Products.product_id ASC
LIMIT 5;

-- Problem 6: Retrieve the users who have made at least one order in each category
-- Write an SQL query to retrieve the users who have made at least one order in each category.
-- The result should include the user ID and username.

SELECT Users.user_id, username
FROM Users JOIN Orders ON Users.user_id = Orders.user_id
JOIN Order_Items ON Orders.order_id = Order_Items.order_id
JOIN Products ON Order_Items.product_id = Products.product_id
JOIN Categories ON Products.category_id = Categories.category_id
GROUP BY Users.user_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Categories.category_id) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Categories);

-- Problem 7: Retrieve the products that have not received any reviews
-- Write an SQL query to retrieve the products that have not received any reviews.
-- The result should include the product ID and product name.
-- Hint: You may need to use subqueries or left joins to solve this problem.
SELECT Products.product_id, product_name
FROM Products LEFT JOIN Reviews ON Products.product_id = Reviews.product_id
WHERE Reviews.review_id IS NULL;

-- Problem 8: Retrieve the users who have made consecutive orders on consecutive days
-- Write an SQL query to retrieve the users who have made consecutive orders on consecutive days.
-- The result should include the user ID and username.
-- Hint: You may need to use subqueries or window functions to solve this problem.
SELECT DISTINCT Users.user_id, username 
FROM Users JOIN Orders O1 ON Users.user_id = O1.user_id
JOIN Orders O2 ON Users.user_id = O2.user_id AND O1.order_date = O2.order_date + 1;
