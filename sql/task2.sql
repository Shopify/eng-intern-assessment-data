-- Problem 5: Retrieve the products with the highest average rating
-- Write an SQL query to retrieve the products with the highest average rating.
-- The result should include the product ID, product name, and the average rating.
-- Hint: You may need to use subqueries or common table expressions (CTEs) to solve this problem.

FROM Products P
LEFT JOIN
    Reviews R ON P.product_id = R.product_id
GROUP BY
    P.product_id, P.product_name
HAVING AVG(R.rating) =(SELECT TOP 1  AVG (R.rating) AS average_rating

-- Problem 6: Retrieve the users who have made at least one order in each category
-- Write an SQL query to retrieve the users who have made at least one order in each category.
-- The result should include the user ID and username.
-- Hint: You may need to use subqueries or joins to solve this problem.

    SELECT id, username from 
        (SELECT
            U.user_id as id, U.username as username,
            count(DISTINCT P.category_id) AS ordered_category

-- Problem 7: Retrieve the products that have not received any reviews
-- Write an SQL query to retrieve the products that have not received any reviews.
-- The result should include the product ID and product name.
-- Hint: You may need to use subqueries or left joins to solve this problem.

SELECT

    P.product_name
FROM
    Products P
LEFT JOIN
    Reviews R ON P.product_id = R.product_id
WHERE
    R.review_id IS NULL;

-- Problem 8: Retrieve the users who have made consecutive orders on consecutive days
-- Write an SQL query to retrieve the users who have made consecutive orders on consecutive days.
-- The result should include the user ID and username.
-- Hint: You may need to use subqueries or window functions to solve this problem.

   WITH OrdersWithDistinctDate AS (
    SELECT
        DISTINCT
        user_id,
        order_date
