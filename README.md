# Data Engineer Intern Assessment, Andrew Zhong

Thank you for your consideration!

## Notes

The work was completed using PostgreSQL.

Due to inconsistencies with the test datasets that were given and the provided schema, filler table entries were provided to satisfy foreign key constraints. Additionally, while Order Item price data did not match the corresponding total price in the Order table, queries were written assuming correct price data and uses unit prices * quantity from Order Items to compute actual order price when ambiguous.

Thanks again for your time.
