Hello,

1) Created a "Sqlite" Database using python and also used python to insert data into the tables. The following files are as follows :-
    a)"createTables.py"  -- python code to create database and the following tables based on the sqlschema
    b)"insertData.py"    -- to insert the data with respect to corresponding tables
    c)"task1.py", "task2.py", "task2.py" -- sqlsolution using pyhton (pure sql solutions are in the section below)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Once the database was created using python also solved in pure sql format
    a)"task1.sql", "task2.sql", "task2.sql"   -- sqlsolutions for the problems

Note1 : the name of the database is "webstore.db" and can be viewed using "https://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/"

Note2 : The passwords in the csv format were stored in plaintext, even though this is just a model , a better way would be to encrypt using base64 or md5.

Note 3 : Not related to the project but just wanted to point out a security flaw in the shopify website. Hackers are using the requests while purchasing the products and mimicing those requests and checking the balance of stolen or hacked credit cards in bulk.
